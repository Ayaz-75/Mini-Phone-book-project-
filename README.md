# 📱 Mini Contact Book (Console App) – Python Project

Welcome to the **Mini Contact Book**, a simple and practical console-based application built using Python. This is Project 2 from my **Stage 1 Python Project Series**, where I'm learning core concepts by building real-world mini apps.

This contact book helps users manage their phone contacts directly from the terminal. It's beginner-friendly and designed to reinforce foundational Python topics like:

- Dictionaries
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- User input
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

---

## 📌 Features

✅ Add new contacts  
✅ View all saved contacts  
✅ Search a contact by name  
✅ Delete a contact  
✅ Exit the program gracefully  

Each contact stores the following information:
- *Name*
- *Phone number (with country code)*
- *Email address*

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

- The app runs in a loop and presents a simple menu to the user.
- You can add as many contacts as you want.
- Data is stored in a Python dictionary where each key is the contact name.
- No external files are used at this stage (future updates will support CSV export).

## 🧠 What I Learned

* Handling user input and working with string formatting.
* Organizing data using Python dictionaries.
* Structuring logic using functions.
* Building a menu-driven console application.
* Debugging and fixing TypeErrors related to sets vs dictionaries.

## 🧱 Future Improvements

* [ ] Save contacts to a `.csv` or `.txt` file
* [ ] Add feature to **update** existing contact
* [ ] Build a GUI version using Tkinter or Streamlit
* [ ] Allow contacts to be loaded from a file on startup
